# Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data

## Business Use Case

This project addresses the crucial task of identifying entities in healthcare data, such as medical records and clinical notes. Extracting key information like medical conditions, treatments, and medications from unstructured text is essential for various healthcare applications. This project aims to automate this process using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, enabling efficient and accurate information extraction for downstream tasks like patient risk stratification, clinical decision support, and research.

## Project
This project uses a Conditional Random Field model to automatically identify key entities, like diseases and treatments, in unstructured healthcare text for various healthcare applications.

## Technology Used

- **Python** is the primary programming language used for this project.
- **Google Colab** is used as the development environment, providing access to computational resources and pre-installed libraries.
- **spaCy** is used for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, essential preprocessing steps for the CRF model.
- **sklearn-crfsuite** provides the implementation of the CRF model used for entity recognition.
- **pandas** and **NumPy** are used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Google Drive** is used for data storage and retrieval.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load the healthcare data from Google Drive.
   - Preprocess the data to recover complete sentences and their corresponding labels.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word tokens, part-of-speech tags, and contextual information.
   - Convert the extracted features into a format suitable for the CRF model.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Initialize and train a CRF model using the preprocessed data and engineered features.
   - Fine-tune the model parameters to achieve optimal performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyze the model's predictions and identify areas for improvement.

5. **Deployment and Application:**
   - Deploy the trained model for real-world use in healthcare settings.
   - Apply the model to extract entities from new healthcare data, supporting various downstream applications.

## Model Performance

The model achieved an F1-score of approximately 0.85 on the test dataset. This indicates a high level of accuracy in identifying entities in healthcare data. Further evaluation and fine-tuning can be explored to improve the model's performance on specific entity types or datasets.

**Note:** Specific performance metrics might vary depending on the dataset and model configuration.

## How to Use

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the steps outlined above.
4. Review the model's performance and predictions.

**Prerequisites:**

- A Google account with access to Google Colab.
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.
